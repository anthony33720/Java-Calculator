# Java-Calculator

## Requirements
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Error handling for invalid inputs
- Support for multiple operations in a single expression


## Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java development environment (IDE).
3. Start working on the `Calculator.java` file to implement the calculator functionality.

## Code Structure
The main class is `Calculator.java`, which contains the entry point for the application. Additional helper methods or classes can be added as needed.

## Usage
1. Run the `Calculator.java` file.
2. Enter a mathematical expression when prompted.
3. The calculator will display the result.
4. Example: `Enter expression: 5 + 3 * 2`
   Output: `Result: 11`

## Testing
Unit tests are provided in the `CalculatorTest.java` file. Run these tests to ensure the correctness of your implementation.

## Troubleshooting
- If you encounter errors, double-check your input format and ensure that you handle edge cases appropriately.

## Conclusion
Congratulations on completing the Java Calculator Exercise! Feel free to explore additional features or improvements to enhance your understanding of Java programming.
